# Portfolio Modeling of 30 Assets

- Modelled a security portfolio in the case of 30 different assets
- Ran a Markowitz optimization to determine the out-of-sample efficient frontier based on the time series of the 120 monthly returns
- Determined the tangency portfolio (Tobinâ€™s two-fund theorem) based on the efficient frontier and the risk-free rate
- Set different rolling estimation windows (120, 480, 600 months) and assumed the tangency portfolio with a rolling window of 600 months performs the best based on sharp ratio
